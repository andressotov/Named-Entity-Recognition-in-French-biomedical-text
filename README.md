Named Entity Recognition in French biomedical text

In this notebook, we will face the problem of identifying entities in French biomedical texts taken from The QUAERO French Medical Corpus (https://quaerofrenchmed.limsi.fr/), developed as a resource for Named Entity Recognition and a gold standard set of normalized entities for French biomedical text. A selection of MEDLINE titles and EMEA documents were manually annotated, following the concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/).
